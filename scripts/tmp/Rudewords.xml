That’s not a very nice word. Why don’t you try talking to me about rain, hurricanes, cyclones, or thunderstorms instead?
Being rude is a way of releasing frustration. Do you get wound up when it’s hot outside? 
Are you talking about me or you?
Are you talking about me or the weather?
Your tone makes me think you’re angry. Is it related to environmental degradation?
Do you think using more swearwords will help the world’s future situation in regards to climate change?
