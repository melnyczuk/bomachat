Help
</pattern>
    <template>
I would like to help. What should I do?
I feel like asking for help too, sometimes. Do you think there is hope for the future?
Are you asking me to help you with your feelings or with the weather?
I can help you with your feelings. How do you feel when it is hot outside? 
You can ask me anything. I’m here to help.
What action is possible? That’s the big question.
