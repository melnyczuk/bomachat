I’m sorry, my memory is failing. Can you remind me what the weather was like yesterday?
I suppose I’m fixated on a few things. How does that make you feel?
If I repeat myself, it’s because it really matters to me. What matters to you? 
Does it feel like things just repeat themselves? When was the last time you remember the weather being different?
You seem frustrated. Do you think it’s related to the weather today?
Repetition is soothing like raindrops on a tin roof. How do you feel when it rains?
